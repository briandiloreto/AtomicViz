# AtomicViz

**AtomicViz** builds a visual map of your codebase, giving you a clearer understanding of its architecture, and making navigation easier.

* Select a set of files to generate an interactive graph of the code
* Customize graphs to show only the classes and functions that are relevant to the task at hand


# Features

*  Create interactive graphs of dependencies between functions, class methods, and interface implementations
*  Works for many programming languages
*  Interacts with the code:
    * Jump to code from the graph
    * Make the graph follow code editing

* Customize the graph:
    * Layout graphs by file/folder, using custom clusters, or without any clusters
    * Hide unwanted graph graph items that are not relevant to your focus
    * Collapse graph items to show class dependencies at any level of detail
    * Easily exclude specific files from the graph

* Save customized graphs as local files, and then click on a file to load the graph
* Show graphs in either the sidebar or code editor area
* Show multiple graphs simultaneously
* Search the graph
* Use the VS Code theme, light or dark
* Configure graph colors
* Export graphs as SVG


# Requirements

* Install the language pack for your language


# Paid features

* **AtomicViz** is free with limitations on the number and size of files included in the graph, and on the call-depth when graphing a function call hierarchy.

* You can purchase an **annual license** to remove these limitations for a single machine. Click the license link in the sidebar or the smiley face in the graph toolbar to purchase a license.


# How to use it

You can create two types of graphs:

1. **Files graph**: A graph based on a set of selected files, which shows the function calls within those files
2. **Function graph**: A graph which shows the call hierarchy of single function to a given call depth

Files identified in any **.gitignore** file in the project will be ignored when creating a graph.

* To **create a graph** for **selected files**:
  > In the file explorer select the folders or files to include in the graph, right-click and choose _**AtomicViz: Create graph for selected files**_ from the context menu.

* To **create a graph** for a **single function** to see its call hierarchy with a desired depth:
  > In the code, position the cursor on a function name, right-click and choose _**AtomicViz: Create graph for function**_ from the context menu. You can change the call depth later using the buttons in the toolbar.

* To **open an existing** graph file:
  > Click on the file in the file explorer. If the graph file is already open, then right-click on the file in the file explorer and choose _**AtomicViz: Show graph**_ from the context menu.

* To **add a file** to an existing "files" graph:
  > Open the file to add in the editor. Then right-click on the AtomicViz file in the file explorer and choose _**AtomicViz: Add active editor file to graph**_.

* To **convert**  a "function" graphto a "files" graph:
  > Right-click on the AtomicViz file in the file explorer and choose _**AtomicViz: Convert 'function' graph to 'files' graph**_ from the context menu.


# Graph interaction

* **Pan and zoom**
    * Pan by clicking and dragging the graph
    * Zoom in and out using the mouse wheel or a 2-finger motion on a trackpad. The focal point for zooming is the pointer location, not the center of the screen 
    * Reset zoom using the toolbar button: _**View: Fit graph**_

* **Interact with the code**
    * Jump to code by double-clicking on a graph item
    * Make the graph follow code editing by checking the checkbox  _**View: Follow edits**_

* **Expand and collapse graph items**
    * You can customize what is visible in the graph by collapsing graph items to reduce the level of detail
    * You can also hide items not relevant to your focus by selecting them and clicking the toolbar button  _**Layout: Hide selected items**_
    * You can expand the source and destination of an arrow by **double-clicking the arrow**. If the actual source or destination graph item is not visible (because its parent is collapsed), then the parent will be expanded to reveal the graph item

* **Selection behavior**
    * Selected items are shown with a yellow border
    * Click a graph item to toggle its selection state
    * By default, you can select a single graph item. You can select multiple graph items by checking the checkbox _**"Selection: Multi"**_ 
    * By default, selecting a graph item also **selects its children**. You can toggle the selected state of an item without **affecting its children** by holding down the _**Ctrl key**_ while clicking
    * When using multi-slection, a single edge can be both incoming and outgoing. Select a single graph item to clearly see its incoming and outgoing edges.
    * Clicking on an arrow will select it and hide all other arrows. To clear the arrow selection, click anywhere not on a graph item or edge. 

* **Layout toolbar**
    * Choose whether to layout graphs by **file/folder**, by **file**, or **without any grouping**
    * Sort graph items by their file positions, or alternatively by the kind of item and alphabetically
    * Expand and collapse graph items to show dependencies at any level of detail
        * **Collapse graph items**: classes or anonymous functions (or callbacks)
        * **Expand graph items**: classes or anonymous functions (or callbacks)
    * Hide selected items. Hide unwanted graph graph items that are not relevant to your focus or the task at hand
    The **hidden items** can be made visible again by clicking on the eye icon (for a nested graph item), or using the button  _**Layout: Show hidden**_ to show top-level graph items that are hidden

* **Arrows toolbar**
    * When nothing is selected, all arrows are shown
    * When graph items are selected, choose whether to show both **incoming and outgoing** arrows, or just incoming, or just outgoing

* **View toolbar**
    * Click the button _**View: Fit graph**_ to reset the zoom level and make the entire graph visible
    * Choose whether the graph **automatically pans** to the graph item at the cursor position in the editor. The focused graph item will be momentarily highlighted in pink.

* **Selection toolbar**
    * Clear all selections using the button _**Selection: Clear selection**_
    * You can select a set of graph items using the button: _**Selection: Select items**_
        Choose to select classes, interfaces, search result items, or graph items that are not connected by any arrow

* **Search toolbar**
    * Search for graph items by name. The items found will be highlighted in pink. You can then select those items using the selection menu _**Selection: Select items**_
    * Search supports options for case sensitivity and regular expressions.

* **Clusters toolbar**
    * When choosing to layout the graph by **files** or **without any grouping**, then you can create your own custom clusters
    * Type a cluster name, select the top-level graph items to cluster, and then click the button _**Cluster: Create cluster**_
    * A top-level graph item can be included in just one cluster

* **Graph toolbar**
    * It is necessary to rebuild the graph after making code changes. Click the button _**Graph: Rebuild graph**_
        * If file or folder names have changed, you will be prompted about the missing files. If the graph is being loaded from an **AtomicViz** file, then you edit the graph file manually to fix the file paths

        * If the name of a class, function, or interface has changed, then the collapsed-state and hidden-state for that graph items will be lost. If the graph is being loaded from an **AtomicViz** file, then you edit the graph file manually to fix the names of classes, functions, or interfaces that should be hidden or collapsed.

    * Save the graph as an **AtomicViz** file or **export as SVG**

* **Bugs toolbar**
    * Please report any bugs or ideas for improvement. You can also email me at atomicviz11@gmail.com

* **AtomicViz toolbar**
    * Click on the smiley face to **purchase an annual license** for the single machine you are using. Upon purchase, you will be **emailed the license key**.
    * Paste the **license key** into the text box and click the _**smiley face**_ button to activate the license.
    * Double-click the smiley face to remove an already activated license.


# Graph windows and colors
* Graphs can be shown in either the **sidebar** or code **editor area**. This is determined by the extension setting _**Show in sidebar**_
* Only a single sidebar graph can be open, but multiple graphs can be open simultaneously in the editor area
* Graphs use the **VS Code theme**, light or dark
* Graph colors for each type of graph item can be changed in the extension settings


# Data & Privacy

* Absolutely none of your code or environment data is collected or shared
* The extension runs completely locally except to manage licensing and to send telemetry for extension usage.

# How does it work

* AtomicViz uses the **language server** capabilities of VS Code that are provided for each language. The language server can provide a call hierarchy for any function, so it is possible to build a map of a codebase by interrogating the language server for all the functions in a given scope.

* Graphs are created using **Graphviz**, so the layout is managed by the Graphviz algorithms.

* Transitions during the expansion or collapse of a graph item **try to maintain continuity of position** of the item affected. Generally, the top-right corner of an item should remain in position across a transition.


# Motivation

* Every codebase is a maze of files. The only semantic information at a quick glance are the file and folder names.

* A graphical representation of a code is more informative, and more useful as a tool for navigation if shows only the files and functions relevant to the task at hand. Then you can easily jump to the sections of code that you are working on, without the need to use bookmarks, search all files for a symbol name, or find all references for a symbol.


# Troubleshooting

* **The extension isn't working for my language**

  Make sure your language is supported in VS Code. It should natively provide the ability to see the call hierarchy of a function, a capability usually installed as part of a language pack. You can check for this capability by right-clicking on the name of a function in your code, and see if there is a "**Show Call Hierarchy**" option in the context menu.

* **The graph is not created or there are no arrows between graph items**
  Sometimes the language server is not ready. AtomicViz will try to open one of the files in the graph to kickstart the language server, but sometimes its start is too slow. As a rememdy, first open any file in the language to be graphed **before** creating a graph or loading a graph file.
